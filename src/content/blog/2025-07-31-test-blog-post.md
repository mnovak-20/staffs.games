Featuring the incredible Jamie Nicholas and Craig Weightman as they explore the creation of VFX for games using the magical power of baked goods! 



Jamie is an exceptional VFX Sorcerer (I would say wizard but we all know Jamie is running a charisma build) who always astounds me with how creative they get with their methods. If you're interested in VFX or the creation of custom particles in Unreal, or if you just really like cookies, consider checking it out!



And that's it for Season 1 of Developer Mode! It's been an incredible experience getting to see this series come to life and I'm so proud of what the team has accomplished! Thank you so much for your hard work everyone, I can't wait to see what we achieve with Season 2! :)
