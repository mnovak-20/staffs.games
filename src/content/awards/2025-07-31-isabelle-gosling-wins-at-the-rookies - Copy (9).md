We took home the gold! StaffsVerse was awarded gold for Innovative Use of Technology at the HEIST Awards 2025.

The award recognises the incredible talent of our Games students and staff who used Unreal Engine to bring our Stoke-on-Trent, Stafford, and London campuses to life in Fortnite. 



Itâ€™s not only a unique way of exploring our campuses and connecting with our community, but an immersive digital experience that reflects our passion to lead the way in games development.



Huge congratulations to the Staffordshire Games Institute at University of Staffordshire and University of Staffordshire London, and the team that represented us at the awards, Chris Headleand, Davin Ward, Callum Lee Roberts, Karl Kellner, and Victoria Searcy.
